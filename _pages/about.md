I joined the [Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Group](https://vision.in.tum.de/){:target="\_blank"} headed by [Prof. Daniel Cremers](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers){:target="\_blank"} at TU Munich in November 2015 as a research assistant and PhD candidate. Before that I received my Computer Science Bachelor's degree from the University of Bonn (in 2013) and my Computer Science Master's degree with distinction from the Technical University Munich (in 2015). During my studies I spend one month (March 2017) at Technion under the supervision of [Prof. Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il){:target="\_blank"} and six months at Facebook Reality Labs under the supervision of [Dr. Tony Tung](https://sites.google.com/site/tony2ng/){:target="\_blank"}.
