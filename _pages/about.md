I am an assistant professor (tenure track) and head of the "Geometry in Machine Learning" group at the University of Bonn, and part of the [Chair for Visual Computing](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and the [Lamarr Institute](https://lamarr-institute.org/). I received my PhD from the Technical University of Munich and was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Siegen. 
I am interested in how geometric properties can be used to form effective priors and guide optimization processes in geometric deep learning and 3D computer vision applications. For example, choosing a different representation can make a huge difference in the capabilities and efficiency of geometric data, particualarly in non-Euclidean domains.
